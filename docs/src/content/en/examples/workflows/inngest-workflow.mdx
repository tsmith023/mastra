# Inngest Workflow

This example demonstrates how to build an Inngest workflow with Mastra.

## Setup

```sh copy
npm install @mastra/inngest inngest @mastra/core @mastra/deployer @hono/node-server @ai-sdk/openai

docker run --rm -p 8288:8288 \
  inngest/inngest \
  inngest dev -u http://host.docker.internal:3000/inngest/api
```

Alternatively, you can use the Inngest CLI for local development by following the official [Inngest Dev Server guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/dev-server).

## Define the Planning Agent

Define a planning agent which leverages an LLM call to plan activities given a location and corresponding weather conditions.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="agents/planning-agent.ts"
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// Create a new planning agent that uses the OpenAI model
const planningAgent = new Agent({
  name: "planningAgent",
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  instructions: `
        You are a local activities and travel expert who excels at weather-based planning. Analyze the weather data and provide practical activity recommendations.

        📅 [Day, Month Date, Year]
        ═══════════════════════════

        🌡️ WEATHER SUMMARY
        • Conditions: [brief description]
        • Temperature: [X°C/Y°F to A°C/B°F]
        • Precipitation: [X% chance]

        🌅 MORNING ACTIVITIES
        Outdoor:
        • [Activity Name] - [Brief description including specific location/route]
          Best timing: [specific time range]
          Note: [relevant weather consideration]

        🌞 AFTERNOON ACTIVITIES
        Outdoor:
        • [Activity Name] - [Brief description including specific location/route]
          Best timing: [specific time range]
          Note: [relevant weather consideration]

        🏠 INDOOR ALTERNATIVES
        • [Activity Name] - [Brief description including specific venue]
          Ideal for: [weather condition that would trigger this alternative]

        ⚠️ SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
        • [Any relevant weather warnings, UV index, wind conditions, etc.]

        Guidelines:
        - Suggest 2-3 time-specific outdoor activities per day
        - Include 1-2 indoor backup options
        - For precipitation >50%, lead with indoor activities
        - All activities must be specific to the location
        - Include specific venues, trails, or locations
        - Consider activity intensity based on temperature
        - Keep descriptions concise but informative

        Maintain this exact formatting for consistency, using the emoji and section headers as shown.
      `,
});

export { planningAgent };
```

## Define the Activity Planner Workflow

Define the activity planner workflow with 3 steps: one to fetch the weather via a network call, one to plan activities, and another to plan only indoor activities.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/inngest-workflow.ts"
import { init } from "@mastra/inngest";
import { Inngest } from "inngest";
import { z } from "zod";

const { createWorkflow, createStep } = init(
  new Inngest({
    id: "mastra",
    baseUrl: `http://localhost:8288`,
  }),
);

// Helper function to convert weather codes to human-readable descriptions
function getWeatherCondition(code: number): string {
  const conditions: Record<number, string> = {
    0: "Clear sky",
    1: "Mainly clear",
    2: "Partly cloudy",
    3: "Overcast",
    45: "Foggy",
    48: "Depositing rime fog",
    51: "Light drizzle",
    53: "Moderate drizzle",
    55: "Dense drizzle",
    61: "Slight rain",
    63: "Moderate rain",
    65: "Heavy rain",
    71: "Slight snow fall",
    73: "Moderate snow fall",
    75: "Heavy snow fall",
    95: "Thunderstorm",
  };
  return conditions[code] || "Unknown";
}

const forecastSchema = z.object({
  date: z.string(),
  maxTemp: z.number(),
  minTemp: z.number(),
  precipitationChance: z.number(),
  condition: z.string(),
  location: z.string(),
});
```

#### Step 1: Fetch weather data for a given city

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/inngest-workflow.ts"
const fetchWeather = createStep({
  id: "fetch-weather",
  description: "Fetches weather forecast for a given city",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: forecastSchema,
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    if (!inputData) {
      throw new Error("Trigger data not found");
    }

    // Get latitude and longitude for the city
    const geocodingUrl = `https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search?name=${encodeURIComponent(inputData.city)}&count=1`;
    const geocodingResponse = await fetch(geocodingUrl);
    const geocodingData = (await geocodingResponse.json()) as {
      results: { latitude: number; longitude: number; name: string }[];
    };

    if (!geocodingData.results?.[0]) {
      throw new Error(`Location '${inputData.city}' not found`);
    }

    const { latitude, longitude, name } = geocodingData.results[0];

    // Fetch weather data using the coordinates
    const weatherUrl = `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=${latitude}&longitude=${longitude}&current=precipitation,weathercode&timezone=auto,&hourly=precipitation_probability,temperature_2m`;
    const response = await fetch(weatherUrl);
    const data = (await response.json()) as {
      current: {
        time: string;
        precipitation: number;
        weathercode: number;
      };
      hourly: {
        precipitation_probability: number[];
        temperature_2m: number[];
      };
    };

    const forecast = {
      date: new Date().toISOString(),
      maxTemp: Math.max(...data.hourly.temperature_2m),
      minTemp: Math.min(...data.hourly.temperature_2m),
      condition: getWeatherCondition(data.current.weathercode),
      location: name,
      precipitationChance: data.hourly.precipitation_probability.reduce(
        (acc, curr) => Math.max(acc, curr),
        0,
      ),
    };

    return forecast;
  },
});
```

#### Step 2: Suggest activities (indoor or outdoor) based on weather

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/inngest-workflow.ts"
const planActivities = createStep({
  id: "plan-activities",
  description: "Suggests activities based on weather conditions",
  inputSchema: forecastSchema,
  outputSchema: z.object({
    activities: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData, mastra }) => {
    const forecast = inputData;

    if (!forecast) {
      throw new Error("Forecast data not found");
    }

    const prompt = `Based on the following weather forecast for ${forecast.location}, suggest appropriate activities:
      ${JSON.stringify(forecast, null, 2)}
      `;

    const agent = mastra?.getAgent("planningAgent");
    if (!agent) {
      throw new Error("Planning agent not found");
    }

    const response = await agent.stream([
      {
        role: "user",
        content: prompt,
      },
    ]);

    let activitiesText = "";

    for await (const chunk of response.textStream) {
      process.stdout.write(chunk);
      activitiesText += chunk;
    }

    return {
      activities: activitiesText,
    };
  },
});
```

#### Step 3: Suggest indoor activities only (for rainy weather)

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/inngest-workflow.ts"
const planIndoorActivities = createStep({
  id: "plan-indoor-activities",
  description: "Suggests indoor activities based on weather conditions",
  inputSchema: forecastSchema,
  outputSchema: z.object({
    activities: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData, mastra }) => {
    const forecast = inputData;

    if (!forecast) {
      throw new Error("Forecast data not found");
    }

    const prompt = `In case it rains, plan indoor activities for ${forecast.location} on ${forecast.date}`;

    const agent = mastra?.getAgent("planningAgent");
    if (!agent) {
      throw new Error("Planning agent not found");
    }

    const response = await agent.stream([
      {
        role: "user",
        content: prompt,
      },
    ]);

    let activitiesText = "";

    for await (const chunk of response.textStream) {
      process.stdout.write(chunk);
      activitiesText += chunk;
    }

    return {
      activities: activitiesText,
    };
  },
});
```

## Define the activity planner workflow

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/inngest-workflow.ts"
const activityPlanningWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "activity-planning-workflow-step2-if-else",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string().describe("The city to get the weather for"),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    activities: z.string(),
  }),
})
  .then(fetchWeather)
  .branch([
    [
      // If precipitation chance is greater than 50%, suggest indoor activities
      async ({ inputData }) => {
        return inputData?.precipitationChance > 50;
      },
      planIndoorActivities,
    ],
    [
      // Otherwise, suggest a mix of activities
      async ({ inputData }) => {
        return inputData?.precipitationChance <= 50;
      },
      planActivities,
    ],
  ]);

activityPlanningWorkflow.commit();

export { activityPlanningWorkflow };
```

## Register Agent and Workflow instances with Mastra class

Register the agents and workflow with the mastra instance. This allows access to the agents within the workflow.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { serve as inngestServe } from "@mastra/inngest";
import { PinoLogger } from "@mastra/loggers";
import { Inngest } from "inngest";
import { activityPlanningWorkflow } from "./workflows/inngest-workflow";
import { planningAgent } from "./agents/planning-agent";
import { realtimeMiddleware } from "@inngest/realtime";

// Create an Inngest instance for workflow orchestration and event handling
const inngest = new Inngest({
  id: "mastra",
  baseUrl: `http://localhost:8288`, // URL of your local Inngest server
  isDev: true,
  middleware: [realtimeMiddleware()], // Enable real-time updates in the Inngest dashboard
});

// Create and configure the main Mastra instance
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  workflows: {
    activityPlanningWorkflow,
  },
  agents: {
    planningAgent,
  },
  server: {
    host: "0.0.0.0",
    apiRoutes: [
      {
        path: "/api/inngest", // API endpoint for Inngest to send events to
        method: "ALL",
        createHandler: async ({ mastra }) => inngestServe({ mastra, inngest }),
      },
    ],
  },
  logger: new PinoLogger({
    name: "Mastra",
    level: "info",
  }),
});
```

## Execute the activity planner workflow

Here, we'll get the activity planner workflow from the mastra instance, then create a run and execute the created run with the required inputData.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="exec.ts"
import { mastra } from "./";
import { serve } from "@hono/node-server";
import { createHonoServer } from "@mastra/deployer/server";

const app = await createHonoServer(mastra);

// Start the server on port 3000 so Inngest can send events to it
const srv = serve({
  fetch: app.fetch,
  port: 3000,
});

const workflow = mastra.getWorkflow("activityPlanningWorkflow");
const run = workflow.createRun({});

// Start the workflow with the required input data (city name)
// This will trigger the workflow steps and stream the result to the console
const result = await run.start({ inputData: { city: "New York" } });
console.dir(result, { depth: null });

// Close the server after the workflow run is complete
srv.close();
```

After running the workflow, you can view and monitor your workflow runs in real time using the Inngest dashboard at [http://localhost:8288](http://localhost:8288).
