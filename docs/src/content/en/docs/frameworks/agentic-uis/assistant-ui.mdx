# Using with Assistant UI

[Assistant UI](https://assistant-ui.com) is the TypeScript/React library for AI Chat.
Built on shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS, it enables developers to create beautiful, enterprise-grade chat experiences in minutes.

## Integrating with Next.js and Assistant UI

There are two primary ways to integrate Mastra into your Next.js project when using Assistant UI:

1. **Full-Stack Integration**: Integrate Mastra directly into your Next.js application's API routes. This approach keeps your backend and frontend code within the same project. [Learn how to set up Full-Stack Integration](#full-stack-integration)
2. **Separate Backend Integration**: Run Mastra as a standalone server and connect your Next.js frontend to its API endpoints. This approach separates concerns and allows for independent scaling. [Learn how to set up Separate Backend Integration](#separate-backend-integration)

## Full-Stack Integration

<Steps>
### Initialize Assistant UI

There are two options when setting up Assistant UI using the `assistant-ui` CLI:

1. **New Project**: Create a new Next.js project with Assistant UI.
2. **Existing Project**: Initialize Assistant UI into an existing React project.

#### New Project

```bash copy
npx assistant-ui@latest create
```

#### Existing Project

```bash copy
npx assistant-ui@latest init
```

<Callout>For detailed setup instructions, including adding API keys, basic configuration, and manual setup steps, please refer to [assistant-ui's official documentation](https://assistant-ui.com/docs).</Callout>


### Install Mastra Packages

Install the required Mastra packages:

```bash copy
npm install @mastra/core@latest @mastra/memory@latest @mastra/libsql@latest
```

### Configure Next.js

To ensure Next.js correctly bundles your application when using Mastra directly in API routes, you need to configure `serverExternalPackages`.

Update your `next.config.js` file to include `@mastra/`:

```js showLineNumbers copy {3}
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  serverExternalPackages: ["@mastra/*"],
  // ... your other Next.js config
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

### Configure Mastra Memory and Storage

```typescript showLineNumbers copy filename="mastra/memory.ts" {4,8}
import { LibSQLStore } from "@mastra/libsql";
import { Memory } from "@mastra/memory";

export const storage = new LibSQLStore({
    url: 'file:./memory.db',
})

export const memory = new Memory({
    storage,
})
```

<Callout>
If deploying to the edge, you should use a compatible storage solution and not a file-based storage.
</Callout>

### Define Mastra Agent

```typescript showLineNumbers copy filename="mastra/agents/chef-agent.ts" {5-12}
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { memory} from "../memory";

export const chefAgent = new Agent({
  name: "chefAgent",
  instructions:
    "You are Michel, a practical and experienced home chef. " +
    "You help people cook with whatever ingredients they have available.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  memory,
});
```

### Register Agent to Mastra Instance

```typescript showLineNumbers copy filename="mastra/index.ts" {4-5}
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { chefAgent } from "./agents/chef-agent";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
    agents: { chefAgent },
    // ... other config
});
```

This initializes Mastra and makes the `chefAgent` available for use.

### Modify the Chat API endpoints

The initial bootstrapped Next.js project has a `app/api/chat/route.ts` file that exports a `POST` handler. The initial implementation may look like this:

```typescript showLineNumbers copy filename="app/api/chat/route.ts" {11-21}
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { frontendTools } from "@assistant-ui/react-ai-sdk";
import { streamText } from "ai";

export const runtime = "edge";
export const maxDuration = 30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages, system, tools } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: openai("gpt-4o"),
    messages,
    // forward system prompt and tools from the frontend
    toolCallStreaming: true,
    system,
    tools: {
      ...frontendTools(tools),
    },
    onError: console.log,
  });

  return result.toDataStreamResponse();
}
```

Now we need to modify the `POST` handler to use the `chefAgent` instead of this implementation.

```typescript showLineNumbers copy filename="app/api/chat/route.ts" {1,6,8}
import { mastra } from "@/mastra";

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();

  const agent = mastra.getAgent("chefAgent");

  const stream = await agent.stream(messages);

  return stream.toDataStreamResponse();
}
```

Key changes
- We import the `mastra` instance we created.
- We use the `mastra.getAgent("chefAgent")` to get the agent we want to use.
- We use the `agent.stream(messages)` to get the stream of messages from the agent.
- We return the stream as a data stream response which is compatible with `assistant-ui`.

### Run the application

You're all set! Start your Next.js development server:

```bash copy
npm run dev
```

You should now be able to chat with your agent in the browser.

</Steps>

Congratulations! You have successfully integrated Mastra into your Next.js application using the full-stack approach. Your Assistant UI frontend now communicates with a Mastra agent running in your Next.js backend API route.

## Separate Backend Integration

Run Mastra as a standalone server and connect your Next.js frontend (with Assistant UI) to its API endpoints.

<Steps>
### Create Standalone Mastra Server

Set up your directory structure. A possible directory structure could look like this:

<FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name="project-root" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="mastra-server" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.Folder name="src">
                <FileTree.Folder name="mastra" />
            </FileTree.Folder>
            <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="nextjs-frontend">
            <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Bootstrap your Mastra server:

```bash copy
npx create-mastra@latest
```

This command will launch an interactive wizard to help you scaffold a new Mastra project, including prompting you for a project name and setting up basic configurations.
Follow the prompts to create your server project.

You now have a basic Mastra server project ready.

<Callout>
Ensure that you have set the appropriate environment variables for your LLM provider in the `.env` file.
</Callout>

### Define Mastra Agent

```typescript showLineNumbers copy filename="mastra/agents/chef-agent.ts" {5-12}
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { memory} from "../memory";

export const chefAgent = new Agent({
  name: "chefAgent",
  instructions:
    "You are Michel, a practical and experienced home chef. " +
    "You help people cook with whatever ingredients they have available.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  memory,
});
```

### Register Agent to Mastra Instance

```typescript copy filename="mastra/index.ts" showLineNumbers
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { chefAgent } from "./agents/chef-agent";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
    agents: { chefAgent },
    // ... other config
});
```

### Run the Mastra Server

Run the Mastra server using the following command:

```bash copy
npm run dev
```

By default, the Mastra server will run on http://localhost:4111. Your chefAgent should now be accessible via a POST request endpoint, typically http://localhost:4111/api/agents/chefAgent/stream. Keep this server running for the next steps where we'll set up the Assistant UI frontend to connect to it.

### Initialize Assistant UI

There are two options when setting up Assistant UI using the `assistant-ui` CLI:

1. **New Project**: Create a new Next.js project with Assistant UI.
2. **Existing Project**: Initialize Assistant UI into an existing React project.

#### New Project

```bash copy
npx assistant-ui@latest create
```

#### Existing Project

```bash copy
npx assistant-ui@latest init
```

<Callout>For detailed setup instructions, including adding API keys, basic configuration, and manual setup steps, please refer to [assistant-ui's official documentation](https://assistant-ui.com/docs).</Callout>

### Configure Frontend API Endpoint

The default Assistant UI setup configures the chat runtime to use a local API route (`/api/chat`) within the Next.js project. Since our Mastra agent is running on a separate server, we need to update the frontend to point to that server's endpoint.

Open the main page file in your Assistant UI frontend project (usually `app/page.tsx` or `src/app/page.tsx`). Find the `useChatRuntime` hook and change the `api` property to the full URL of your Mastra agent's stream endpoint:

```typescript showLineNumbers copy filename="app/page.tsx" {2}
const runtime = useChatRuntime({
    api: "http://localhost:4111/api/agents/chefAgent/stream",
});
```

Now, the Assistant UI frontend will send chat requests directly to your running Mastra server.

### Run the Application

You're ready to connect the pieces! Make sure both the Mastra server and the Assistant UI frontend are running. Start the Next.js development server:

```bash copy
npm run dev
```

You should now be able to chat with your agent in the browser.

</Steps>

Congratulations! You have successfully integrated Mastra with Assistant UI using a separate server approach. Your Assistant UI frontend now communicates with a standalone Mastra agent server.
