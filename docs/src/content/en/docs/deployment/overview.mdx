# Deployment Overview

Mastra offers multiple deployment options to suit your application's needs, from fully-managed solutions to self-hosted options, and web framework integrations. This guide will help you understand the available deployment paths and choose the right one for your project.

## Deployment Options

### Mastra Cloud

Mastra Cloud is a deployment platform that connects to your GitHub repository, automatically deploys on code changes, and provides monitoring tools. It includes:

- GitHub repository integration
- Deployment on git push
- Agent testing interface
- Comprehensive logs and traces
- Custom domains for each project

### With a Web Framework

Mastra can be integrated with a variety of web frameworks. For example, see one of the following for a detailed guide.

- [With Next.js](/docs/frameworks/web-frameworks/next-js)
- [With Astro](/docs/frameworks/web-frameworks/astro)

When integrated with a framework, Mastra typically requires no additional configuration for deployment.

### With a Server

You can deploy Mastra as a standard Node.js HTTP server, which gives you full control over your infrastructure and deployment environment.

- Custom API routes and middleware
- Configurable CORS and authentication
- Deploy to VMs, containers, or PaaS platforms
- Ideal for integrating with existing Node.js applications

### Serverless Platforms

Mastra provides platform-specific deployers for popular serverless platforms, enabling you to deploy your application with minimal configuration.

- Deploy to Cloudflare Workers, Vercel, or Netlify
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Simplified deployment process
- Automatic scaling through the platform

## Client Configuration

Once your Mastra application is deployed, you'll need to configure your client to communicate with it. The Mastra Client SDK provides a simple and type-safe interface for interacting with your Mastra server.

- Type-safe API interactions
- Authentication and request handling
- Retries and error handling
- Support for streaming responses
