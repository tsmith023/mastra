# Creating and Calling Agents

Agents in Mastra are systems where the language model can autonomously decide on a sequence of actions to perform tasks. They have access to tools, workflows, and synced data, enabling them to perform complex tasks and interact with external systems. Agents can invoke your custom functions, utilize third-party APIs through integrations, and access knowledge bases you have built.

Agents are like employees who can be used for ongoing projects. They have names, persistent memory, consistent model configurations, and instructions across calls, as well as a set of enabled tools.

## 1. Creating an Agent

To create an agent in Mastra, you use the `Agent` class and define its properties:

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/agents/index.ts" copy
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

export const myAgent = new Agent({
  name: "My Agent",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
});
```

**Note:** Ensure that you have set the necessary environment variables, such as your OpenAI API key, in your `.env` file:

```.env filename=".env" copy
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Also, make sure you have the `@mastra/core` package installed:

```bash npm2yarn copy
npm install @mastra/core@latest
```

### Registering the Agent

Register your agent with Mastra to enable logging and access to configured tools and integrations:

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { myAgent } from "./agents";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { myAgent },
});
```

## 2. Generating and streaming text

### Generating text

Use the `.generate()` method to have your agent produce text responses:

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy
const response = await myAgent.generate([
  { role: "user", content: "Hello, how can you assist me today?" },
]);

console.log("Agent:", response.text);
```

For more details about the generate method and its options, see the [generate reference documentation](/reference/agents/generate).

### Streaming responses

For more real-time responses, you can stream the agent's response:

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy
const stream = await myAgent.stream([
  { role: "user", content: "Tell me a story." },
]);

console.log("Agent:");

for await (const chunk of stream.textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}
```

For more details about streaming responses, see the [stream reference documentation](/reference/agents/stream).

## 3. Structured Output

Agents can return structured data by providing a JSON Schema or using a Zod schema.

### Using JSON Schema

```typescript
const schema = {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    summary: { type: "string" },
    keywords: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } },
  },
  additionalProperties: false,
  required: ["summary", "keywords"],
};

const response = await myAgent.generate(
  [
    {
      role: "user",
      content:
        "Please provide a summary and keywords for the following text: ...",
    },
  ],
  {
    output: schema,
  },
);

console.log("Structured Output:", response.object);
```

### Using Zod

You can also use Zod schemas for type-safe structured outputs.

First, install Zod:

```bash npm2yarn copy
npm install zod
```

Then, define a Zod schema and use it with the agent:

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy
import { z } from "zod";

// Define the Zod schema
const schema = z.object({
  summary: z.string(),
  keywords: z.array(z.string()),
});

// Use the schema with the agent
const response = await myAgent.generate(
  [
    {
      role: "user",
      content:
        "Please provide a summary and keywords for the following text: ...",
    },
  ],
  {
    output: schema,
  },
);

console.log("Structured Output:", response.object);
```

### Using Tools

If you need to generate structured output alongside tool calls, you'll need to use the `experimental_output` property instead of `output`. Here's how:

```typescript
const schema = z.object({
  summary: z.string(),
  keywords: z.array(z.string()),
});

const response = await myAgent.generate(
  [
    {
      role: "user",
      content:
        "Please analyze this repository and provide a summary and keywords...",
    },
  ],
  {
    // Use experimental_output to enable both structured output and tool calls
    experimental_output: schema,
  },
);

console.log("Structured Output:", response.object);
```

<br />

This allows you to have strong typing and validation for the structured data returned by the agent.

## 4. Multi-step Tool use Agents

Agents can be enhanced with tools - functions that extend their capabilities beyond text generation. Tools allow agents to perform calculations, access external systems, and process data. For details on creating and configuring tools, see the [Adding Tools documentation](/docs/agents/using-tools-and-mcp).

### Using maxSteps

The `maxSteps` parameter controls the maximum number of sequential LLM calls an agent can make, particularly important when using tool calls. By default, it is set to 1 to prevent infinite loops in case of misconfigured tools. You can increase this limit based on your use case:

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/agents/index.ts" copy
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import * as mathjs from "mathjs";
import { z } from "zod";

export const myAgent = new Agent({
  name: "My Agent",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant that can solve math problems.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: {
    calculate: {
      description: "Calculator for mathematical expressions",
      schema: z.object({ expression: z.string() }),
      execute: async ({ expression }) => mathjs.evaluate(expression),
    },
  },
});

const response = await myAgent.generate(
  [
    {
      role: "user",
      content:
        "If a taxi driver earns $9461 per hour and works 12 hours a day, how much do they earn in one day?",
    },
  ],
  {
    maxSteps: 5, // Allow up to 5 tool usage steps
  },
);
```

### Using onStepFinish

You can monitor the progress of multi-step operations using the `onStepFinish` callback. This is useful for debugging or providing progress updates to users.
`onStepFinish` is only available when streaming or generating text without structured output.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/agents/index.ts" copy
const response = await myAgent.generate(
  [{ role: "user", content: "Calculate the taxi driver's daily earnings." }],
  {
    maxSteps: 5,
    onStepFinish: ({ text, toolCalls, toolResults }) => {
      console.log("Step completed:", { text, toolCalls, toolResults });
    },
  },
);
```

### Using onFinish

The `onFinish` callback is available when streaming responses and provides detailed information about the completed interaction. It is called after the LLM has finished generating its response and all tool executions have completed.
This callback receives the final response text, execution steps, token usage statistics, and other metadata that can be useful for monitoring and logging:

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/agents/index.ts" copy
const stream = await myAgent.stream(
  [{ role: "user", content: "Calculate the taxi driver's daily earnings." }],
  {
    maxSteps: 5,
    onFinish: ({
      steps,
      text,
      finishReason, // 'complete', 'length', 'tool', etc.
      usage, // token usage statistics
      reasoningDetails, // additional context about the agent's decisions
    }) => {
      console.log("Stream complete:", {
        totalSteps: steps.length,
        finishReason,
        usage,
      });
    },
  },
);
```

## 5. Running Agents

Mastra provides a CLI command `mastra dev` to run your agents behind an API. By default, this looks for exported agents in files in the `src/mastra/agents` directory.

### Starting the Server

```bash
mastra dev
```

This will start the server and make your agent available at `http://localhost:4111/api/agents/myAgent/generate`.

### Interacting with the Agent

You can interact with the agent using `curl` from the command line:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4111/api/agents/myAgent/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, how can you assist me today?" }
    ]
  }'
```
