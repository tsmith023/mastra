# Local Development Environment

Mastra provides a local development environment where you can test your agents, workflows, and tools while developing locally.

<YouTube id="spGlcTEjuXY" />

## Launch Development Server

You can launch the Mastra development environment using the Mastra CLI by running:

```bash
mastra dev
```

By default, the server runs on localhost at http://localhost:4111. Custom port and host can be configured via the
mastra server config.

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  server: {
    port: "4111",
    host: "0.0.0.0",
  },
});
```

## Dev Playground

`mastra dev` serves a playground UI for interacting with your agents, workflows, and tools. The playground provides dedicated interfaces for testing each component of your Mastra application during development.

### Agent Playground

The Agent playground provides an interactive chat interface where you can test and debug your agents during development. Key features include:

- **Chat Interface**: Directly interact with your agents to test their responses and behavior.
- **Prompt CMS**: Experiment with different system instructions for your agent:
  - A/B test different prompt versions.
  - Track performance metrics for each variant.
  - Select and deploy the most effective prompt version.
- **Agent Traces**: View detailed execution traces to understand how your agent processes requests, including:
  - Prompt construction.
  - Tool usage.
  - Decision-making steps.
  - Response generation.
- **Agent Evals**: When you've set up [Agent evaluation metrics](/docs/evals/overview), you can:
  - Run evaluations directly from the playground.
  - View evaluation results and metrics.
  - Compare agent performance across different test cases.

### Workflow Playground

The Workflow playground helps you visualize and test your workflow implementations:

- **Workflow Visualization**: Workflow graph visualization.

- **Run Workflows**:

  - Trigger test workflow runs with custom input data.
  - Debug workflow logic and conditions.
  - Simulate different execution paths.
  - View detailed execution logs for each step.

- **Workflow Traces**: Examine detailed execution traces that show:
  - Step-by-step workflow progression.
  - State transitions and data flow.
  - Tool invocations and their results.
  - Decision points and branching logic.
  - Error handling and recovery paths.

### Tools Playground

The Tools playground allows you to test your custom tools in isolation:

- Test individual tools without running a full agent or workflow.
- Input test data and view tool responses.
- Debug tool implementation and error handling.
- Verify tool input/output schemas.
- Monitor tool performance and execution time.

## REST API Endpoints

`mastra dev` also spins up REST API routes for your agents and workflows via the local [Mastra Server](/docs/deployment/server). This allows you to test your API endpoints before deployment. See [Mastra Dev reference](/reference/cli/dev#routes) for more details about all endpoints.

You can then leverage the [Mastra Client](/docs/deployment/client) SDK to interact with your served REST API routes seamlessly.

## OpenAPI Specification

`mastra dev` provides an OpenAPI spec at http://localhost:4111/openapi.json

To enable OpenAPI documentation in your Mastra instance, add the following configuration:

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  server: {
    build: {
      openAPIDocs: true, // Enable OpenAPI documentation
      // ... other build config options
    },
  },
});
```

## Swagger UI

Swagger UI provides an interactive interface for testing your API endpoints at `mastra dev` provides an OpenAPI spec at http://localhost:4111/swagger-ui.
To enable Swagger UI in your Mastra instance, add the following configuration:

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  server: {
    build: {
      openAPIDocs: true, // Enable OpenAPI documentation
      swaggerUI: true, // Enable Swagger UI
      // ... other build config options
    },
  },
});
```

## Local Dev Architecture

The local development server is designed to run without any external dependencies or containerization. This is achieved through:

- **Dev Server**: Uses [Hono](https://hono.dev) as the underlying framework to power the [Mastra Server](/docs/deployment/server).

- **In-Memory Storage**: Uses [LibSQL](https://libsql.org/) memory adapters for:

  - Agent memory management.
  - Trace storage.
  - Evals storage.
  - Workflow snapshots.

- **Vector Storage**: Uses [FastEmbed](https://github.com/qdrant/fastembed) for:
  - Default embedding generation.
  - Vector storage and retrieval.
  - Semantic search capabilities.

This architecture allows you to start developing immediately without setting up databases or vector stores, while still maintaining production-like behavior in your local environment.

### Model settings

The local development server also lets you configure the model settings in Overview > Model Settings.

You can configure the following settings:

- **Temperature**: Controls randomness in model outputs. Higher values (0-2) produce more creative responses while lower values make outputs more focused and deterministic.
- **Top P**: Sets cumulative probability threshold for token sampling. Lower values (0-1) make outputs more focused by considering only the most likely tokens.
- **Top K**: Limits the number of tokens considered for each generation step. Lower values produce more focused outputs by sampling from fewer options.
- **Frequency Penalty**: Reduces repetition by penalizing tokens based on their frequency in previous text. Higher values (0-2) discourage reuse of common tokens.
- **Presence Penalty**: Reduces repetition by penalizing tokens that appear in previous text. Higher values (0-2) encourage the model to discuss new topics.
- **Max Tokens**: Maximum number of tokens allowed in the model's response. Higher values allow for longer outputs but may increase latency.
- **Max Steps**: Maximum number of steps a workflow or agent can execute before stopping. Prevents infinite loops and runaway processes.
- **Max Retries**: Number of times to retry failed API calls or model requests before giving up. Helps handle temporary failures gracefully.

## Summary

`mastra dev` makes it easy to develop, debug, and iterate on your AI logic in a self-contained environment before deploying to production.
