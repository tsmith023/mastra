# Mastra Tools for your agentic IDE

`@mastra/mcp-docs-server` provides direct access to Mastra's complete knowledge base in Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, or any other IDE that supports MCP.

It has access to documentation, code examples, technical blog posts / feature announcements, and package changelogs which your IDE can read to help you build with Mastra.

<YouTube id="vciV57lF0og" />

The MCP server tools have been designed to allow an agent to query the specific information it needs to complete a Mastra related task - for example: adding a Mastra feature to an agent, scaffolding a new project, or helping you understand how something works.

## How it works

Once it's installed in your IDE you can write prompts and assume the agent will understand everything about Mastra.

### Add features

- "Add evals to my agent and write tests"
- "Write me a workflow that does the following `[task]`"
- "Make a new tool that allows my agent to access `[3rd party API]`"

### Ask about integrations

- "Does Mastra work with the AI SDK?
  How can I use it in my `[React/Svelte/etc]` project?"
- "What's the latest Mastra news around MCP?"
- "Does Mastra support `[provider]` speech and voice APIs? Show me an example in my code of how I can use it."

### Debug or update existing code

- "I'm running into a bug with agent memory, have there been any related changes or bug fixes recently?"
- "How does working memory behave in Mastra and how can I use it to do `[task]`? It doesn't seem to work the way I expect."
- "I saw there are new workflow features, explain them to me and then update `[workflow]` to use them."

**And more** - if you have a question, try asking your IDE and let it look it up for you.

## Automatic Installation

For **new** projects, the MCP Docs Server can be added during installation either through the [interactive](/docs/getting-started/installation#interactive) setup prompts, or by specifying the `-m` flag using the [non-interactive](/docs/getting-started/installation#non-interactive) command.

## Manual Installation

To add the MCP Docs Server to an existing project, install it manually.

- **Cursor**: Edit `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root, or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` for global configuration
- **Windsurf**: Edit `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` (only supports global configuration)
- **VSCode**: Edit `~/.vscode/mcp.json` in your project root
  Add the following configuration:

## After Configuration

### Cursor

If you followed the automatic installation, you'll see a popup when you open cursor in the bottom left corner to prompt you to enable the Mastra Docs MCP Server.

  alt="Diagram showing cursor prompt to enable Mastra docs MCP server"
  width={800}
/>

Otherwise, for manual installation, do the following.

1. Open Cursor settings
2. Navigate to MCP settings
3. Click "enable" on the Mastra MCP server
4. If you have an agent chat open, you'll need to re-open it or start a new chat to use the MCP server

### Windsurf

1. Fully quit and re-open Windsurf
2. If tool calls start failing, go to Windsurfs MCP settings and re-start the MCP server. This is a common Windsurf MCP issue and isn't related to Mastra. Right now Cursor's MCP implementation is more stable than Windsurfs is.

In both IDEs it may take a minute for the MCP server to start the first time as it needs to download the package from npm.

### VSCode

1. Open VSCode settings
2. Navigate to MCP settings
3. Click "enable" on the Chat > MCP option

<br />

<img

MCP only works in Agent mode in VSCode. Once you are in agent mode, open the `mcp.json` file and click the "start" button.

After starting the mcp server, click the tools button in the copilot pane to see available tools.
